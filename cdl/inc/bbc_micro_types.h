/*t t_bbc_keyboard */
/**
 * The BBC keyboard consists of a keyboard matrix with ten columns of
 * eight rows of keys. The columns can be individually powered, and
 * then the eight rows can be read as a byte to see which of the
 * column's keys is pressed. There is an additional 'Break' key that
 * is independent of the keyboard matrix, that provides a reset signal
 * to the motherboard.
 *
 * This structure is used to pass the keyboard state in to the BBC
 * micro implementation - since an ASIC of FPGA does not contain a
 * physical keyboard, the key pressed information needs to be conveyed
 * over a bus from outside. This structure permits this.

/*t t_bbc_pixels_per_clock */
/**
 * The BBC micro operates with a variable speed pixel clock - it can
 * be 12MHz or 16MHz. Furthermore, for some graphics 'modes' the
 * number of real pixels per clock tick drops as pixels are
 * replicated, to enable pixel information to be used for color
 * selection. Hence 8 pixel per clock at 2MHz is 2 colors for 16Mpps,
 * whereas 2 pixels per clock at 2MHz indicates 16Mpps where each
 * pixel is replicated 4 times over, and can be of 2^4=16 different
 * colors. Mode 2 uses bbc_ppc_2; modes 1 and 5 use bbc_ppc_4; modes
 * 0, 3, 4 and 6 use bbc_ppc_8. Note that modes 0-3 run with 640 base
 * pixels at 16MHz, hence 40us of pixel data per row.
 *
 * For teletext mode the pixel rate is officially 12Mpps, as the
 * teletext characters are 12 pixels wide and there are 40 characters
 * per screen (hence roughly 480 pixels wide, and at 12Mpps that is
 * 40us).

 * The BBC micro output from its video ULA is separate red, green and
 * blue pixel data, and sync signals. This structure conveys this
 * information out of the BBC implementation, plus the number of
 * pixels per clock, so that the display interface may be clocked at
 * 2MHz. For modes where there are fewer than 8 pixels per clock, the
 * red, green and blue data is replicated throughout the bus - so the
 * only real need for pixels_per_clock is to indicate if the pixel
 * clock rate is 12MHz or 16MHz (it is 12MHz if bbc_ppc_6)

 * stream of SRAM write transactions, each of 16 pixels.

 * The module itself is configured through a CSR request interface to
 * set the base address of the frame buffer (amongst other things).

 * Each sector on a floppy has a descriptor that includes byte fields
 * for the head, logical sector number, and the head/sector length

/*t t_bbc_floppy_op */
/**
 * The floppy op structure is used to convey a floppy operation from
 * the FDC to the floppy drive; it is effectively an internal set of
 * signals that are driven inside the FDC to the floppy controller,
 * which converts them to analog data or other control signals to the
 * floppy drive interface.
 *
 * The structure has no 'valid' signal - it is valid on every clock
 * tick. However, control signals are required to toggle on and toggle
 * off - it is the 'rising edge' of step_out, step_in, next_id,
 * read_data_enable, etc that cause those to occur.
 *
 * step_out and step_in are mutually exclusive; step_out moves the
 * head out towards the outer rim of the disc, which is where track 0
 * is.
 *
 * next_id is asserted if the drive should read the next sector ID (in
 * reality waiting for the disc to spin round until a sector id
 * descriptors is decoded from the surface) from the disc. In response
 * to this, some time later, a floppy response with a valid sector_id
 * should be presented.
 *
 * read_data_enable is asserted if the next word (32 bits) of sector
 * data should be read from the disc surface. This should only be
 * asserted after a 'next_id', or after a previous
 * 'read_data_enable'. After a 'next_id' it causes the first data word
 * of the sector for which the sector id was returned; otherwise it
 * continues data from that sector.
 *
 * write_data_enable and write_data are not currently used. They
 * should be used to write the data after a 'next_id' has been
 * asserted, at 32 bits per write.
 *
 * write_sector_id_enable and sector_id are not currently used. They
 * should be used to write the sector id data for a sector. This is
 * generally done on a floppy disc controller only when formatting a
 * track, and so in fact may never be implemented (if formatting is
 * assumed to be hard as opposed to soft).

 * The floppy response structure conveys data back from the floppy
 * drive interface to the FDC in response to the floppy operation.
 *
 * sector_id_valid is asserted for a single clock tick in conjunction
 * with valid sector_id data in response to a 'next_id' rising edge in
 * the floppy operation; this may occur any number of clock ticks
 * after the request, and in the intervening period no other requests
 * are permitted.
 *
 * read_data_valid is asserted for a single clock tick in conjunction
 * with valid read_data in response to a 'read_data_enable' floppy
 * operation; this may occur any number of clock ticks after the
 * request, and in the intervening period no other requests are
 * permitted.
 *
 * index is asserted if the latest sector_id is the first physical
 * sector of the track - i.e. if the 'index hole' on the floppy disc
 * is at that point. On a real floppy disc the index hole need not be
 * anywhere near an actual valid sector data field, but for the
 * emulation the index value is valid for the whole of the period from
 * one sector_id_valid to the next.
 * 
 * track_zero is asserted if the current track is track zero. This
 * becomes asserted when the drive is 'stepped out' to the outermost
 * track (i.e. the physical track number is decremented to 0).
 *
 * disk_ready is asserted if there is a floppy in the drive.
 * 
 * write_protect is asserted if the floppy in the drive has a write
 * protect tab on it.

 * to reach it, when it may then remove the 'valid' (for at least one
